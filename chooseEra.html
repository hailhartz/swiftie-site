                <h3>Ours</h3>
                <p>"Ours" is a song that discusses a happy relationship between two people
                    that continues in spite of the dreary world surrounding them. Swift
                    wrote this song about her relationship with John Mayer, who 
                    was 10 years older than her at the time, but I think that the song
                    is sweet nonetheless.

                <h3>Enchanted</h3>
                <p>
                    "Enchanted" chronicles the experience of meeting someone for the first
                    time and being "enchanted" by them. Allegedly the song is about Adam Young, 
                    the lead singer of Owl City. He wrote a response song but it was released 
                    after the moment of "Enchanted" passed.

                <h3>Speak Now</h3>
                <p>
                    The thesis of Swift's album is embodied by "Speak Now," which tells 
                    the story of a girl crashing her ex-boyfriend's wedding. While Swift 
                    has never objected to anyone's wedding (in real life), the song is 
                    rumored to be about her friend Hayley Williams. I like how the song is 
                    fun and upbeat.

                <h3>Look What You Made Me Do</h3>
                <p>
                    "Look What You Made Me Do" is definitely one of Swift's most 
                    notorious songs, but its for good reason. This is the first song 
                    that Swift released after facing extreme backlash during her feud 
                    with Kanye West, with a music video that poked fun at her different 
                    personas over the years.

                <p>
                    While Reputation was marketed as a villian or revenge album, 
                    it has its fair share of love songs. "Call It What You Want" was 
                    likely written about Swift's former long-term boyfriend Joe Alwyn. 
                    It discusses Alwyn staying by Swift's side while she felt she was 
                    losing her career and repuation.

                <h3>Getaway Car</h3>
                <p>
                    On the surface, "Getaway Car" tells the story of a woman betraying her 
                    partner in crime. The song is likely an allegory for betrayal in 
                    one of Swift's real-life relationships. I think that the 
                    song is thrilling to listen to with the story's highs and lows.

                <h3>august</h3>
                <p>
                    Folklore is unique from Swift's other albums since 
                    in this album, instead of writing songs solely based on 
                    her own experiences, she expanded to telling 
                    completely fictional stories. "august" tells the bittersweet story of 
                    a love triangle from the "other" woman's perspective.

                <p>
                    The song "this is me trying" discusses a lot of 
                    the struggles that come with important transitions in life. 
                    The subject of the song grapples with moving on from 
                    a breakup and generally echoes a feeling of being lost in life.

                <h3>my tears ricochet</h3>
                <p>
                    I've always thought that "my tears ricochet" was 
                    written from the perspective of a ghost looking over 
                    her funeral. I like how the song a very haunting feeling. 
                    The song discusses the subject's greivances with 
                    a former partner or friend.
